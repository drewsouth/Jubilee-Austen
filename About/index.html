                <div class="half-width">
                    <p>I’ve made my home base in Providence, Rhode Island, with my small growing family. My journey into
                        tech started with a degree in journalism. As I started sharing my writing online, I was
                        fascinated with how easily I could get my voice out there. I was hooked and wanted to learn how
                        to build my own site to fit my own specific needs.</p>

                    <p>That curiosity then op<span>ened a door that could never be</span> shut. When I learned how <span>to build my first
                        website, I</span> realized I found something <span>that gave me the freedom &amp;</span> versatility I was looking
                        for <span>in my work. Now I’ve made a</span> full switch to front-end deve<span>lopment, where I can use my</span>
                        organization skills and eye for det<span>ail to write clean,</span> elegant code.</p>
